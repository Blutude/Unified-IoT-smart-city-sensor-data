Storing smart city sensor data to CosmosDB in a unified and generic format

Smart city is about merging the innovative technology with human life in the city. The goal is to optimize circulation flow, safety and city maintenance efficiency.

The program parses and unifies raw sensor data in a generic way for all different types of sensors, and uploads it to Azure's CosmosDB. The key and url strings are left empty in the repository for privacy reasons.

There is also a UI program that vizualises the data stored in the database using matplotlib.
